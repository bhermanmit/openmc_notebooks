This repository contains a set of simple OpenMC examples that illustrate important
physics.

Two Region - Two Energy Group Tally Fuel/Reflector Slab
-------------------------------------------------------

This problem configures a 1-D slab problem with a UO2-H2O fuel mixture\
surrounded by H2O reflector. OpenMC tallies are made for standard
two energy group flux and energy-integrated fission rate. Plots highlight
thermal flux build-up near fuel/reflector boundary.
